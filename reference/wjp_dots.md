# Plot a Dots Chart following WJP style guidelines

**\[experimental\]**

`wjp_dots()` takes a data frame with long-format data and returns a
ggplot object with a dots chart following WJP style guidelines. Dots
charts compare multiple variables (rows) across groups (colors) on a
horizontal 0-100 percentage scale, with an alternating strip background.

## Usage

``` r
wjp_dots(
  data,
  target,
  grouping,
  colors,
  cvec = NULL,
  order = NULL,
  diffOpac = FALSE,
  opacities = NULL,
  diffShp = FALSE,
  shapes = NA,
  draw_ci = FALSE,
  sd = NULL,
  sample_size = NULL,
  bgcolor = "#ffffff",
  labels = NULL,
  show_labels = FALSE,
  label_offset = 0.32,
  ptheme = WJP_theme(),
  show_legend = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  Data frame containing the data to plot.

- target:

  String. Column name of the variable that supplies the values to plot.

- grouping:

  String. Column name of the variable that supplies the categories
  (Y-axis labels).

- colors:

  String. Column name of the variable that supplies the color grouping.
  The plot shows a different color per group.

- cvec:

  Named vector of colors. Names should match the values of the `colors`
  variable. Default is `NULL` (the WJP palette, see
  [`wjp_palette()`](https://worldjusticeproject.github.io/WJPr/reference/wjp_palette.md),
  is applied).

- order:

  String. Column name of the variable that contains the display order of
  categories. Default is `NULL` (data order).

- diffOpac:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, different opacity levels are applied per group.
  Automatically enabled when `opacities` is supplied. Default is
  `FALSE`.

- opacities:

  Named vector of opacity levels, one per group. Default is `NULL`.

- diffShp:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, different point shapes are applied per group.
  Automatically enabled when `shapes` is supplied. Default is `FALSE`.

- shapes:

  Named vector of point shapes, one per group. Default is `NA`.

- draw_ci:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, draws a normal-approximation confidence interval
  using `sd` and `sample_size`. Default is `FALSE`.

- sd:

  String. Column name of the variable that supplies the standard
  deviation for the confidence intervals.

- sample_size:

  String. Column name of the variable that supplies the number of
  observations for the confidence intervals.

- bgcolor:

  String. Hex code of the background color for the alternating row
  strips. Default is `"#ffffff"`.

- labels:

  String. Column name of the variable containing the value labels to
  display above each point. Only used when `show_labels = TRUE`. Default
  is `NULL` (labels are generated automatically as rounded percentages).

- show_labels:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, draws a value label above each point. When several
  series in the same row share equal or near-equal values, the labels
  are spread horizontally with
  [`spread_labels_x()`](https://worldjusticeproject.github.io/WJPr/reference/spread_labels_x.md)
  so they do not overlap, and identical labels within a row are
  collapsed to a single mark. Points are never moved. Default is
  `FALSE`.

- label_offset:

  Numeric. Vertical distance (in category units) between each point and
  its value label. Only used when `show_labels = TRUE`. Default is
  `0.32`.

- ptheme:

  ggplot theme to apply. Default is
  [`WJP_theme()`](https://worldjusticeproject.github.io/WJPr/reference/WJP_theme.md).

- show_legend:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, displays a horizontal color legend above the
  chart. Default is `FALSE`.

## Value

A ggplot object.

## Details

The function expects long-format data with one row per `grouping`
(variable/row) and `colors` (group) combination. To draw a 95%
normal-approximation confidence interval around each dot, set
`draw_ci = TRUE` and supply per-row standard deviations (`sd`) and
sample sizes (`sample_size`). Per-group opacities (`opacities`) and
point shapes (`shapes`) can be supplied to distinguish groups beyond
color.

## Examples

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Always load the WJP fonts
wjp_fonts()

# Percentage of people that trust their institutions, by country

  ) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)) %>%

    trust  = case_when(q1a <= 2 ~ 100, q1a <= 4 ~ 0),
    gender = case_when(gend == 1 ~ "Male", gend == 2 ~ "Female")
  ) %>%
  group_by(country, gender) %>%
  summarise(

# With value labels spread horizontally to avoid collisions
wjp_dots(

  grouping    = "institution",
  colors      = "country",
  show_labels = TRUE
